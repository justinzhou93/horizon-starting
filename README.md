# Horizon

If you have ever felt that reading the news ever got too repetitive or time consuming, Horizon has the answer.

Justin Zhou and Jaekwang Seo created this hackathon application to automatically compile news on a daily basis, filtering out any stop words and counting word frequency of words in the articles. The most frequently-appearing—and presumably relevant—words, are then compiled into a word cloud and presented to the user.
